Add a dice roll to generate a random number from one to ten
if less than 1]0 result one - if more then 2

maybe as a third option -- let the char decide and do
a dice roll.


need to figure out a way to have the program end
after a death so the second level doesnt resume
despite the death. - mauybe it does this automatically?
because the program redirects to the death method
which ends at a specific point?
